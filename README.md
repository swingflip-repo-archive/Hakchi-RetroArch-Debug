# Hakchi-RetroArch-Debug
A debug launcher for RetroArch.

This custom built app launches retroarch in full verbose mode meaing that all the output for RetroArch is recorded onto the USB enabling you to troubleshoot any issues with retroarch or your roms.

It also dumps all the config folder, it's contents and the core and personal config files to the usb too.

These are located at: /media/log/ and /media/log/RetroArchConfig

Again, all you do is click and drag the zip onto your hakchi like a rom. Easy peasy!

This module will be included in my upcoming hakchi options pack but might be a good standalone app for someone having issues with retroarch.

Many thanks to SuperAwesome for the icon.
